Interest on a credit cardâ€™s unpaid balance is calculated using the average daily balance.
Write a program that accepts as input netBalance, payment, d1, d2, and interest rate per month. The program outputs the
interest. Format your output to two decimal places and use a thousands separator for the dollar amounts.
